## üìä Project Overview

This **Password Strength Checker** evaluates passwords based on these criteria:
- **Length**: Minimum of 8 characters.
- **Uppercase Letters**: At least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Letters**: At least one lowercase letter.
- **Digits**: At least one number.
- **Special Characters**: Includes special symbols like `@`, `#`, etc.

Based on these criteria, the program provides feedback on password strength:
- **Strong Password**: Meets all criteria.
- **Moderate Password**: Missing only one criterion.
- **Weak Password**: Missing two or more criteria.
- **Very Weak Password**: Fails to meet most criteria.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive and User-Friendly**: The tool provides instant feedback on the password's strength, with an option to check multiple passwords in a single session.
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: For terminals supporting ANSI codes, the program highlights feedback in color (e.g., red for weak, green for strong).
- **Cybersecurity-Focused**: Developed by **Shazil Shahid**, a cybersecurity enthusiast, to encourage secure password practices.
